The bot's has multiple functionalities.
One of its functions is to return encouraging words like "Never give up!" if the user inputs any sad words such as depressed, sad, angry, etc. 
Encouraging words can be creating a function to add encouraging words by creating a database to store new words. Newly added words can be deleted as well. Another function is if the user asks the bot to say some inspiring words using the !Inspire command, it returns inspiring words from an API called Zen Quotes.
